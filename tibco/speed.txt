The provider selection is a three-step process.
•	First,  the system will select providers ELIGIBLE for bidding (offer and response) base on ranking of likelihood of timeliness of arrival (predictive criteria). Base on this criterion, offers will be sent.
•	Second, providers (dispatcher, mobile users or automated system logic) will reply with an ETA bid. 
•	Lastly, the system will select the best provider based on the received bid responses and weighted by multiple factors (auction criteria).

Sending multiple drivers and letting consumer pick the driver is not included in the current release. A single best match for a driver will be sent to consumer application and will be selected by default.

ETA - estimated time of arrival


Formula for unable to meet ETA: System ETA > ETA at bid.
