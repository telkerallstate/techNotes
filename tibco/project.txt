GHR mobile app?



We have started testing for Text To Web project in QA01 env. Currently we are not able to see the status change in mobile web status screen when the status is changed from RoadSmart Gateway or RoadSmart Mobile.



The field destination business name is used to store the dealership name or any business name where the vehicle is being towed.
So this applies only to Tow services, there is no destination address required for any other type of service.




RSP Assist communicates with Roadside Assistance Providers who offer car breakdown services by two means:
•	Mobile application
•	Gateway – a web based application




Then using the same GUID and Request Id you can open the Text to Web app ??


for each service we have 4 seeders and 1 proxy
