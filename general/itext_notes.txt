What is the default font used in iText, and can I change it? The default font
in iText is Helvetica with size 12 pt. There’s no way to change this. If you
need objects with another default font, just create a factory class that produces
objects with the font of your choice.




When you add a PdfPTable to a Document, only complete rows are
added. If you have a table with three columns and your final row has only
two cells, the row won’t be added unless you use the method PdfPTable.
completeRow().


You don’t have to worry about creating rows; iText creates them for you. Just make
sure you’re adding the correct number of cells.



Is it possible to have the column width change dynamically based on the content
of the cells? PDF isn’t HTML, and a PdfPTable is completely different from an
HTML table rendered in a browser; iText can’t calculate column widths
based on the content of the columns.



PdfPTable table = new PdfPTable(3);
table.setWidthPercentage(288 / 5.23f);
table.setWidths(new int[]{2, 1, 1});


table.setTotalWidth(288);
table.setLockedWidth(true);
table.setWidths(new float[]{2, 1, 1});

PdfPTable table =
new PdfPTable(new float[]{ 2, 1, 1 });
table.setWidthPercentage(55.067f);


Internally, PdfPCell content is kept inside a ColumnText object



cell.setPadding(10);

table.addCell(
"different padding for left, right, top and bottom");
cell.setPaddingLeft(20);
cell.setPaddingRight(50);
cell.setPaddingTop(0);
cell.setPaddingBottom(5);



setFixedHeight()
setNoWrap(true)
