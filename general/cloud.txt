cloud computing - separation of application and OS and hardware


virtualization is part of cloud computing

googledoc - try it

load balancing in cluster

in mainframe env ..all the processing happens on mainframe server which are connected to multiple dumb terminals


terminal services server - allows terminal services clients - thin clients

application servers - (not webapps) - installed on TS - the thin client jst openup only the software install on applicaiotn server

virtualization software
	client installed, hypervisor


virtualbox/vmwarefusion - free try it

client installed - hardware->OS->virtualbox->another/multiple OS

hypervisor(like OS) - EXSI (free)- connected to management software(vssphere,for FT)
can transfer instance of OS,applicaitons on other server that has EXSI


hosted solutions 		vs hosted instances
everythhing is provided		our server setup on cloud

private cloud - virtualisation in our premises...not on internet



thin client can be software or hardware


edge servers of hosted solutions companies


containers can enable your company to pack a lot more applications into a single physical server than a virtual machine (VM) can. Container technologies, such as Docker, beat VMs at this part of the cloud or data-center game


Hosting Static files in Cloud Foundry
Normally, deploying static files requires a webserver like Apache or Nginx. But we’re not going to have to worry about that: the platform will automatically take care of any Internet-facing configuration we’ll need. You only need to push your application files to the Cloud Foundry environment and everything else will be taken care of.
